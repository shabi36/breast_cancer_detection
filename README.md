# 🎗️ **Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning**  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases worldwide. **Early detection** plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates. This project leverages **machine learning** 🤖 to classify **benign and malignant tumors** using a **tabular dataset**, helping in quick and accurate diagnosis.  

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to develop a **binary classification model** that accurately predicts whether a tumor is **benign (non-cancerous) 🟢** or **malignant (cancerous) 🔴**, assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.  

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of **various medical attributes** related to tumor characteristics, such as:  
🔬 **Mean Radius** – The average size of the tumor.  
📏 **Texture Mean** – Surface characteristics of the tumor.  
⚖️ **Perimeter & Area** – Shape and size indicators.  
🩺 **Concavity & Compactness** – Measures of how much the tumor shape deviates from normal.  
📉 **Fractal Dimension** – Complexity of the tumor boundary.  

Data preprocessing ensures that missing values are handled, outliers are removed, and feature scaling is applied for optimal model performance.  

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Approach**  
Different **classification models** were tested to achieve the best accuracy:  
✅ **Logistic Regression**  
✅ **Random Forest Classifier**  
✅ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
✅ **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**  

Performance evaluation is based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, ensuring the model provides reliable predictions.  

## 🔄 **Workflow**  
🔹 **Data Preprocessing**  
   - 📥 Load and clean the dataset.  
   - 🛠️ Handle missing values and outliers.
