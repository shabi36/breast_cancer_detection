# Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning (PyTorch)  

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify breast cancer based on tabular data, helping in early diagnosis and decision-making. Using PyTorch, a neural network model is trained on structured medical data to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.  

## **Project Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to build an accurate and efficient deep learning model that can classify breast cancer cases using structured, tabular medical data. Unlike traditional image-based detection methods, this project focuses on numerical attributes such as tumor size, cell shape, and other clinical features.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used for this project consists of various diagnostic measurements collected from patients. Each instance in the dataset represents a tumor and includes several numerical attributes describing its characteristics. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)**. The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize features, and split into training and testing sets.  

## **Model Architecture**  
The project implements a **fully connected neural network (FCNN)** using PyTorch. The model consists of:  
- **Input Layer:** Takes the numerical features as input.  
- **Hidden Layers:** Fully connected layers with activation functions such as ReLU to introduce non-linearity.  
- **Output Layer:** A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to classify the tumor as benign (0) or malignant (1).  

The model is trained using **binary cross-entropy loss** and optimized with **Adam optimizer**. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## **Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load and clean the dataset.  
   - Normalize feature values for better model performance.  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Define the neural network architecture using PyTorch.  
   - Train the model on the processed dataset.  
   - Use backpropagation and optimization techniques to minimize loss.  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Test the trained model on unseen data.  
   - Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.  

4. **Inference**  
   - Make predictions on new patient data.  
   - Interpret model results for practical use in medical diagnosis.  

## **Results & Future Improvements**  
The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying breast cancer cases. Future improvements include:  
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying and incorporating additional relevant features.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing learning rate, batch size, and architecture.  
- **Explainability:** Using SHAP or LIME to interpret model decisions.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in medical diagnosis. By utilizing tabular data and neural networks, it provides an effective method for early breast cancer detection. Future enhancements will focus on improving interpretability and clinical applicability.
